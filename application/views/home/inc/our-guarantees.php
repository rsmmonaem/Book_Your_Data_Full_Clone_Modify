<h3 class="primary-title">95% DELIVERABILITY GUARANTEE</h3>
<p>All of our email lists come with a 95% deliverability guarantee.* Why not 100%? The reason for this is
that in the world today, people are constantly changing jobs and/or positions, and companies
may move and change their telephone numbers, names, websites, or email addresses. In order to
keep up with a world that changes rapidly, we update our database daily using thousands of
sources, but because contact info can change so much and so quickly, it is impossible to reach
100% deliverability in this industry. Our aim is to provide you the most up-to-date data. Right now,
there isn’t a single company in the world that will deliver such qualified data with lower
prices than Bookyourdata.com — we are perfectly sure about that!</p>

<h3 class="primary-title">Bounce-Back Guarantee</h3>
<p>We know it is bad when a customer thinks the service they received wasn’t worthy of its price.
To prevent such situations, we promise a 95% deliverability rate with our data. If a customer runs
across an deliverability level lower than 95%, simply send us the report showing the hard-bounce
rate of the email list purchased and we will provide free data credits until our 95% deliverability
promise is satisfied. For example, if the hard-bounce rate appears to be 20%, meaning the
deliverability level is 80%, we will provide free credits for 15% more data. Thus, you’ll always
get what you paid for.</p>
